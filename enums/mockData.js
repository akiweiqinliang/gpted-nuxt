             islands such as the Australian mainland, Tasmania, and overseas territories.

              To the east lies the Coral Sea and Tasman Sea in the Pacific Ocean, while to the north, west, and south lies

               the Indian Ocean and its marginal seas. The total area is 7688200 square kilometers, and the coastline is
                36735 kilometers long. The northern region has a tropical climate, while the majority has a temperate climate. The country is divided into 6 states and 2 regions. As of September 2023, the total population of Australia is 26.82 million, with 51.1% being of British and Irish descent. The official language is English, and approximately 43.9% of residents believe in Christianity. The other five major religions are Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, and Judaism. 38.9% of the population have no religious beliefs or unknown religious beliefs. The earliest inhabitants of Australia were Indigenous Australians. In 1770, British navigator James Cook arrived on the east coast of Australia and declared that Britain occupied this land. On January 26, 1788, Britain began establishing colonies in Australia, which was later designated as Australia Day. In July 1900, the British Parliament passed the "Australian Federal Constitution" and the "British Dominion Ordinance". On January 1, 1901, the various colonies in Australia were converted into states, and in October of the same year, the Commonwealth of Australia was established. In 1931, Australia became an independent country within the Commonwealth. Australia is a developed modern industrial country, the most economically developed country in the southern hemisphere, the fourth largest exporter of agricultural products in the world, and also an important producer and exporter of mineral products in the world. Agriculture, animal husbandry, and mining are traditional industries, while manufacturing and high-tech industries are developing rapidly. The service industry has become the leading industry in the national economy. With the development of foreign trade, the economy has maintained rapid growth. Australia has a stable social environment and a regulated financial system. In the 2021/2022 fiscal year, Australia's GDP was AUD 2.1 trillion.`,
